# What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

# A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of elements. Tuples are written with round brackets ().

# List is mutable, Tuple is immutable.

# List uses square brackets [], Tuple uses parentheses ().

# List elements can be changed, Tuple elements cannot be changed.

# Lists are slower, Tuples are faster in performance.

# Lists use more memory, Tuples use less memory.

# Lists have more built-in methods, Tuples have fewer methods.

# Lists are used for dynamic data, Tuples are used for fixed data.

# Lists are less secure, Tuples are more secure (due to immutability).

# Lists are preferred for frequent changes, Tuples are preferred for read-only data.

# Lists can be copied and modified, Tuples can be copied but not modified.
