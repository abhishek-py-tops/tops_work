# Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

# Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).

# It supports:

# Code reuse

# Hierarchy

# Extensibility

# Parent class
# class Animal:
#     def __init__(self, name):
#         self.name = name

#     def speak(self):
#         return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

# # Child class
# class Dog(Animal):
#     def speak(self):
#         return f"{self.name} barks"

# # Instantiation
# d = Dog("Tommy")
# print(d.speak())   # Output: Tommy barks

# __init__() is a special method called constructor.

# It is automatically invoked when an object is created.

# Used to initialize object attributes.
