# # What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?

# # A class is like a blueprint (e.g., Car, Student, Dog).

# # An object is a real-world instance created based on that blueprint.

# # Instantiation is when you call the class like a function to create that object.

# class Student:
#     def __init__(self, name):
#         self.name = name

# # ðŸ”¸ Instantiation
# s1 = Student("Alice")  # <--- This is instantiation
