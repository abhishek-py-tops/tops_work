# What is .Django URLs?make program to create django urls ? 
# In Django, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are used to map web addresses (like /home/, /about/) to views (Python functions or classes that handle the request and return a response).

# Django uses a URL dispatcher that matches the requested URL to a function (called a view).

# Route incoming browser requests to the right view.

# Define the structure of your web application.

# Enable clean, human-readable URLs.

# Example :-  
# from django.contrib import admin
# from django.urls import path, include

# urlpatterns = [
#     path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
#     path('', include('myapp.urls')),  # includes app URLs
# ]
